# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project I've completed for the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief provided through the program.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform
- Hover Transitions
- Pseudo classes

## Plan on improving the project

- In regards to improving this project, I will soon explore different and more complex styles, involving different hover animations, text / font coloring & styling, images, and background colors, I also may explore tiny, smooth animations for the landing page using keyframes. Lastly, I will improve upon the <nav> link styles and add cards for the menu section.
